### ⚠️ Important: About the Windows Defender Warning

When you run the installer, you will likely see a blue screen from **Microsoft Defender SmartScreen** saying:

> *"Windows protected your PC"*

#### Why does this happen?

This is a standard security warning from Windows for any new application from a developer it does not recognize. **Your application is safe**, but because it is **not digitally signed with a commercial certificate**, Windows shows this alert as a precaution.

#### What to do?

This is normal. To continue with the installation:

1. Click on the **"More info"** link.
2. A new button labeled **"Run anyway"** will appear.
3. Click on it to **proceed with the installation**.

Once installed, the application will run **automatically in the background** and can be **configured from the system tray icon**.
